This is application of the 2 opt* a local search heuristic for solving the TSP very efficiently. 
In this heuristic the two edges in the route are swapped for the main aim to take a route that crosses over itself and reorder it so that it does not.A complete 2-opt local search will compare every possible valid combination of the swapping mechanism. 
This technique can be applied to the traveling salesman problem as well as many related problems.
